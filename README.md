# Gym-Management-System-Java-GUI-Application 
This project is a Java-based Gym Management System designed to streamline and automate the operations of a gym or fitness center. The system uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make it user-friendly and easy to navigate for gym staff and management.

# Key Features:

### Member Management:
Allows gym administrators to add, update, and delete member records. Each memberâ€™s profile includes personal details such as name, contact information, membership type, and start/end dates.
Trainer Scheduling: Manage gym trainers' schedules by assigning them to specific members or classes.
### Membership Plans:
The system supports different membership plans (monthly, quarterly, yearly) and can track payments, renewal dates, and pending dues.
Attendance Tracking: Track daily attendance of gym members, including their check-in and check-out times.
### Class Management:
Organize and schedule fitness classes, assign trainers, and track member participation.
Reporting: Generate reports for memberships, attendance, and financial summaries.
Technologies Used:
### Java Swing/AWT: 
For creating the user-friendly GUI.
### JDBC:
For database connectivity to store and manage data.
### MySQL/SQLite:
Database to store member, trainer, and transaction records.
### MVC Architecture: 
Implements Model-View-Controller architecture for better code management and scalability.
This project helps gym owners and staff efficiently manage their day-to-day tasks, reducing paperwork and improving operational efficiency.
